## Devlog
1. Lillian Su, she/her
2. The plan my group wrote corresponds to how I created the code for the game. We decided that the player movement with the WASD keys would need to be handled through the Update method that runs every frame. Additionally, we decided that there would need to be a member variable of the player class that tells the console the amount of plant seeds possessed currently. The UI would have text for seed remaining and seeds planted. Following this plan, I was able to code and execute the game.
